# Advent of Code
This is where I'll be posting my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024.

## PGGM
I have created this repository so my colleagues @ PGGM can ~~steal some code~~ take inspiration from my solutions.  
I'll be using C# && (JetBrains) Rider, so if you're using VS20** you might need to add some .gitignore lines.

## Structure

### Files
I'll be adding the input files under a folder `inputs` so I can couple them to my specific solution.  
You might need your own input files to get a correct result. 

### Challenges
I'll try to keep the code organized for each challenge, but I will change it as I see fit.
It might not be possible to run the first few challenges after the later ones come out.
